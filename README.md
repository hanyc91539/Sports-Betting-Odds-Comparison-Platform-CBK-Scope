## 1. UX Design (Figma) and User Interface
	• Ready-Made Template Customization: The platform will begin with a pre-designed template (most likely from Figma), which will be customized based on the client's needs. They will need contacts for assistance with modifying the template.
	• Key Pages/Sections:
		○ Home Page: The home page will feature an odds comparison tool that compares betting odds for various sports. The layout needs to show:
			§ A login/signup form (using email, password, or Gmail login).
			§ A subscription page for users to choose plans.
			§ Filters for users to select which sports, sportsbooks, or markets (types of bets) they want to compare.
			§ Odds Comparison: A grid that shows odds for different events across various sportsbooks. The grid will include:
				□ Event names
				□ Best odds (calculated using a formula that compares the odds for home/away or over/under teams and selects the best available line).
				□ Average odds.
				□ Sportsbook-specific odds with logos and odds.
		○ Arbitrage Betting: A key feature to show users arbitrage opportunities where they can place bets with guaranteed profits. The page will show:
			§ Filters: Users can filter by odds range, profit percentage, sportsbooks, and sports.
			§ Arb Screen: Lists:
				□ Profit percentages.
				□ Event details (match name, leagues).
				□ Bet and sportsbook details.
				□ A bet details pop-up with calculations showing which sportsbooks offer the best lines for placing the bet.
		○ +EV Betting (Positive Expected Value): A screen showing bets with a positive expected value. The user can filter:
			§ Odds range, profit %, and other factors.
			§ EV%, event names, and odds.
			§ The ability to click on bet details and check the probability of winning, fair odds, etc.
		○ Pinnacle Line Betting Tool: Tracks abnormal odds movements, comparing Pinnacle's odds with other sportsbooks like Bet365, William Hill, etc. Alerts will trigger when there's a significant odds movement, showing both the original and changed odds. Integration with Discord and Telegram is required for alerts.
		○ Online Bet Tracker: A tool for users to track their bets, showing:
			§ Sportsbook, event time, bet amount, odds, status (won, loss, pending), bet type (normal, +EV, arb), etc.
			§ This tracker should allow users to add bets manually and provide betting analysis in the form of graphs and tables.
			§ The tracker will also allow users to mark bet results once the event concludes (win/loss/void), and automatically update the status.
		○ Payment Integration: Stripe will be integrated for payments.
## 2. Betting Calculators & Widgets
	• There will be a tab with multiple betting calculators to help users calculate potential profits, odds, and other betting-related data. The client intends to use pre-made widgets or scripts for this functionality, possibly sourced from Google or other external libraries, reducing development time.
## 3. User and Affiliate Management
	• User Dashboard: A backend dashboard that the client controls, where they can manage users and marketing tools.
	• Affiliate Dashboard: Special features for affiliate users, including:
		○ Custom links for user referrals.
		○ Affiliate income tracking.
		○ Ability to monitor leads and campaign performance.
	• Marketing tools will be integrated, likely for affiliate management, referral programs, and user growth tracking.
## 4. Sports and Sportsbooks Covered
	• The platform will cover major sports like:
		○ NFL, NBA, Soccer (top leagues) such as EPL, Serie A, UCL, etc.
		○ NHL, Golf, Tennis (major golf and tennis events).
	• Sportsbooks: The platform will aggregate odds from various top sportsbooks, such as:
		○ Bet365, Pinnacle, DraftKings, FanDuel, BetMGM, Caesars, William Hill, and more.
## 5. Integration with External APIs
	• The platform will need to integrate with various APIs to fetch data from sportsbooks and provide deep linking functionality. For example, clicking on a bet could take the user to the corresponding event or sportsbook page.
	• Real-Time Updates: Integrating with Discord and Telegram for notifications about new betting opportunities, odds changes, and alerts.
## 6. Features and Functionalities Recap:
	• Home Page with odds comparison and product promotions.
	• Filters for selecting sports, odds range, sportsbooks, and events.
	• Arbitrage and +EV Betting Tools for finding profitable bets.
	• Pinnacle Line Tool for tracking abnormal odds movements.
	• Online Bet Tracker with detailed bet management and analysis.
	• User Dashboards for both regular users and affiliates.
	• Stripe Payment Integration for handling subscriptions and payments.
	• Betting Calculators to assist users in calculating potential returns and analyzing odds.

## Technical Considerations:
	• The platform will need to handle real-time data processing and aggregation, likely requiring back-end development with APIs from multiple sportsbooks.
	• The front-end will need to be responsive (for mobile and desktop) and user-friendly, with features like charts, graphs, and filters to make complex betting data easier to navigate.
	• Security for user data, especially for login and payment functionalities (using OAuth for authentication and Stripe for secure payment handling).

## Conclusion:
This platform will serve as an all-in-one tool for sports bettors, providing them with odds comparison, arbitrage opportunities, and bet tracking. It will incorporate real-time data, advanced betting tools, and seamless integration with popular sportsbooks and messaging platforms like Discord and Telegram. The goal is to create a highly dynamic and user-friendly platform that appeals to both casual and serious sports bettors.
